        <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span> Elasticity: Shifting the Risk</h2>

        <p>
            To have a brief overview on Cloud Computing economic models, <i>A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing</i><sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> suggests that the phrase "pay as you go" captures the economic benefit to the buyer, although the economic appeal of Cloud Computing is often described as "converting capital expenses to operating expenses". <i>(i.e. CapEx to OpEx)</i>
            
            <br>In a more concrete way to explain this advantage would be the non-uniformly distribution of hours you purchased. This way of selling strategy is known as <i>usage-based pricing</i><sup><a href="#1">[2]</a></sup>
        </p>


        <p>
            <br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in" aria-hidden="true"></span> <em>Let's start elasticity with an easy example.</em>
        </p>

        <br><center><img src="ex1.png" height="150"></center>

        <p>
            <br>From the example shown above, we can easily find out that the elasticity plays an important role in reducing the waste of non-used server-hours. Therefore, the total cost we paid for paying-as-you-go is obviously less than what we usually pay for buying all the sever-hours. <i>(Figure (a))</i>
            
        </p>

            <p>Nevertheless, this example is inadequate to demonstrate the advantages of paying-as-you-go compared with buying. What's more, most services experience much periodic demand variation as well as some unexpected events, which cause the sharp increase of the demand variation. This, furthermore, has a bad influence on the buying the server-hour, as it underestimates the total volume of services and this could have a severe consequence that a significant number of customers would, therefore, be lost forever due to poor services.<i>(Figure (b))</i>
            

        </p>

        <p>
            Figure(c) described another possibility of underprovision of customers, the capacity equals to the demand variation in some time, but not always. In this case, the turned away customers are fewer than which in Figure(b), but this causes same consequences as well - still losing a potential amount of customers.

        <p>
            <br>Do such scenarios really exist in our daily life?
            <br><br> Here is a real-world example. 
            <br><br>When Animoto <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> made his service available via Facebook, it experienced a super surge which resulted in a 7000% times more servers needed in three days. At first, no one ever expected this tremendous increase of customers. Originally they decided to have only 35 servers in total. Although the average amount of customers is under control, Animoto determined that he would not let any customers down due to underestimation of stripe value, hence the server doubled every 12 hours for 3 days.

        <p><br>The left-hand side demonstrates the expected profit earning from cloud computing, multiplying the user hours by the net revenue. 
            On the right-hand side, it gives a fixed-capacity datacenter in the average utilization by doing the similar calculation. The greater value of either side represents the opportunity for large profit. This links to our next sub-topic.<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></span>

        <h2><br><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gbp" aria-hidden="true"></span>Comparing Costs: Should I Move to the Cloud?</h2>

        <p>
            <br>This section will guide you through another essential aspect of Cloud Computing: "Is it more economical to move my existing datacenter-hosted service to the cloud, or to keep it in a datacenter?"<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>The table below updates Gray’s 2003 cost data <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup> to 2008, allowing us to track the rate of change of key technologies for Cloud Computing for the last 5 years.
        </p>

            <br><center><img src="costtable.png" height="300"/></center>

        <P><br>To make the table easier to understand, Gray calculated what could be bought in 2003 using $1. In the table above, it shows those figures as well as the figure in 2008. At first glance, it seems that one dollar will go further if it was used to purchase hardware in 2008 than to pay for use of that same hardware. However, this simple analysis glosses over several important factors.<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>
                    
        <p><b><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bell" aria-hidden="true"></span> Pay seperately per resource</b>&nbsp;: Because most of the users do not usually make equal use of storage, computation and network; some of these are network-bounded, some are CPU-bounded and so on. Cloud Computing enables users to pay separately per resources. Therefore, the total waste of resources and money can be kept to a lowest bound.
            
        </p>

        <p><b><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bell" aria-hidden="true"></span> Power, cooling and physical plant costs</b>&nbsp;: So far, from the above simple analysis, we have not covered the cost of power, cooling system, physical plants, and the amortized cost of building them. Hamilton estimates that the costs of CPU, storage and bandwidth roughly double when those costs are amortized over the building’s lifetime <sup><a href="#7">[7,8]</a></sup> The cost would be expectedly high when considering those aspects.

        <p><b><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bell" aria-hidden="true"></span> Operations costs</b>&nbsp;: Nowadays, hardware operations costs are very low. One minimally trained staff is able to operate and replace the broken components on the server level. On one hand, because the Utility Computing uses virtual machines instead of physical machines, from a cloud user's perspective, it could be much easier to operate as those Cloud Computing servers are provided by the organization, rather than building or maintain the hardware block all by themselves. However, on the other hand, we still need to take the cost of software management into account, including upgrading, applying patches, and so on.
        </p>

            <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in" aria-hidden="true"></span> <em>With the above caveats in mind, here is a simple example of deciding whether to move a service into the cloud.</em></p>

            <br><center><img src="ex3.png" height="200"/></center>

        <p><br> Lastly, another related issue which needed to be taken into account is the software complexity and the costs of migrating all the data from the previous datacenter to the Cloud. While this action can be made at one go, the effort required to accomplish this is still significant. This, however, results in spawning new business opportunities for companies that provide data transformation across private and public Clouds.
