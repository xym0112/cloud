        <p>Datacenters are huge devices that use electrical power and produce heat in the process. It has a cooling system whose job is to remove that heat. This consumes additional energy which also has to be removed. Most of the money is spent either on power conditioning and distribution or on cooling systems.<a href="#ref_basics"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats"></span> Different Tiers of Datacenters</h3>
        <p>The design of a datacenter can be classified into different tiers:</p>

        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-duplicate"></span> Redundancy</h3>
        <p>Redundancy is needed for a variety of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the service is in high demand, you need to make sure that it’s available almost all of the time so that the consumer can access it.</li>
            <li>Important data is stored in more than one place so there are backups.<a href="#ref_basics"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span> Inner Workings of the Datacenter</h3>
        <p>Power enters building from outside transformer <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span> it stops at the primary switchgear which includes breakers to protect it against electrical faults and has transformers which scale the
        voltage down to 400-600V <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span> the low voltage power flows to Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) which has a second feed at the same voltage so that the diesel generators can be used if the utility power fails <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span> UPS output is routed to Power Distribution Units (PDUs) which take a high voltage feed (usually 200-480V) and split it into smaller circuits – typically 110 or 220V. Each circuit has its own breaker so that if there is a ground short, only that breaker would be affected and not the entire PDU.
        </p>
        <img src="image13.png" alt="Inside of a Datacenter model" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;">
        <h3 id="ups"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-flash"></span> The UPS</h3>
        <p>The role of the UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains transfer switch whose job is to choose the active power input whether that’s the generator power or the utility power.</li>
            <li>Contains batteries or flywheels which bridges the time between when the utility fails to when the generator power is available.</li>
            <li>Removes voltage spikes or sags from incoming power feed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Due to its size, the UPS is contained in a separate room and not on the datacenter floor. Size can range from hundreds of kilowatts to 2MW.</p>
        <h3 id="cooling"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-fire"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down"></span> Cooling</h3>
        <p>Normally, the datacenter’s floor is raised. The underfloor area can be used to route the power cables to the racks, but its main use is to distribute the cool air to the server racks.</p>
        <h4>CRAC Units</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>From the 1960s term for Computer Room Air Conditioning</li>
            <li>Blows cold air into the underfloor area which escapes via the perforated tiles arranged in front of the server racks. It flows through the servers expelling warm air in the back.</li>
            <li>To avoid mixing hot and cold air (which reduces cooling efficiency), the racks are placed in such a way that the hot and cold aisles are alternating.</li>
            <li>Liquid coolant is pumped through coils</li>
            <li>Fans push air through these coils which cool it</li>
            <li>Can change amount of cooling that comes in by changing the arrangement of perforated tiles – could replace solid tiles with perforated ones or vice versa - depending on what outcome you would like. </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="image4.png" alt="CRAC units diagram" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;">
        <p>In more recent datacenters, other methods of cooling can also be used.</p>
        <p>Free cooling is more energy efficient as opposed to just cooling with a chiller.</p>
        <h4>Water based free cooling via cooling tower</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooling towers pre-cool the condenser water loop fluid through free cooling before it reaches the chiller.</li>
            <li>Cooling towers dissipate heat</li>
            <li>Water absorbs the coolant’s heat in a heat exchanger in a separate cooling loop.</li>
            <li>Warm water flows away and evaporates, thus cooling down.</li>
            <li>Works best in low humidity climate</li>
            <li>Aren’t suited to colder climates because you have to have other instruments to stop the ice from forming on the tower</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Free cooling via glycol-based radiator</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Placed outside the building to dissipate heat</li>
            <li>Works best in cold climates</li>
            <li>Isn’t optimal in warmer temperature since heat exchange isn’t as good with air-to-air convection when you compare with evaporation<a href="#ref_basics"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></span> Location Considerations for a Datacenter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a place where it’s less susceptible to natural disasters</li>
            <li>climate - locations where the climate is cooler might lower costs as the outside air can be used to help cool the datacenter<a href="#ref_basics"><sup>[4]</sup></a></li>
            <li>access to reliable power</li>
            <li>access to cooling solutions</li>
            <li>Total Cost of Ownership - e.g. property price, operating expenses, cost of maintenance<a href="#ref_basics"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li>
            <li>reliable access to network</li>
            <li>proximity to workforce<a href="#ref_basics"><sup>[6]</sup></a></li>
